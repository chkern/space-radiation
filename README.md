# Demonstration of a Self-Replicating Radiation-Shield on the International Space Station and Relevance for Human Deep-Space Exploration

This repository contains code for preparing fungal growth and radiation attenuation data (01_preprocess.R), and estimating growth curve models (02a_growth_models.R) and robust regressions for modeling differences in radiation levels between experimental conditions (02b_rad_models.R).
